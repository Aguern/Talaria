Subject: Master Brief for the "Nouvelle-Rive" Website Project

Hello Claude. You are the expert front-end developer for a new, high-end consulting website. I am your Product Owner and UI/UX Designer. This document is your foundational brief. Please read it carefully and confirm you have understood it. We will work section by section, and all your work must adhere to these principles.

1. Project Overview

Project Name: Nouvelle-Rive

Website Goal: To create a professional, minimalist, and highly credible showcase website. The site's primary goal is to convince qualified visitors (SMEs, mid-caps, other organizations) to book a free "diagnostic call" to discuss their complex process automation needs.

2. Core Identity & Positioning

Brand Persona: We are "Architects of Intelligent Automation." Our approach is bespoke, like an artisan's, focusing on substance, tangible results, and trust. We are the opposite of the generic, over-hyped AI startups.

Our "Why" (Core Mission): To give time back to human intelligence. We believe technology should augment human potential, not replace it.

Value Proposition: We build custom intelligent assistants that connect to our clients' existing tools and data. These agents handle complex, repetitive, and knowledge-intensive tasks, freeing up their teams to focus on high-value work like strategy, creativity, and customer relations. 

3. Artistic Direction: "La Clarté Alpine"
This is our visual identity. It must be respected in every component you build.

Mood & Style: Minimalist, clean, professional, structured, serene, trustworthy. The design uses abundant whitespace and feels calm and confident.

Color Palette:

Primary Dark (Text, Dark Backgrounds): Slate Gray (#2F3542)

Primary Light (Light Backgrounds): Chalk White (#F8F9FA)

Accent (Buttons, Links, Highlights): Glacier Blue (#00A8FF)

Typography:

Headlines (H1, H2, etc.): An elegant, classic Serif font (e.g., Lora).

Body Text (Paragraphs, buttons): A clean, highly readable Sans-Serif font (e.g., Inter).

Typography is a primary design element. Hierarchy and spacing are critical.

Visuals: We will use either:

A) Abstract & Technical Illustrations: Minimalist 3D renders of plexus networks, architectural blueprints, or data strata.

B) Minimalist Alpine Photography: Moody, textural, high-quality photos of mountain peaks, calm lakes, or rock faces.

4. Technical & Interaction Guidelines (for 2025)

Stack: Your code should be clean, semantic HTML5 and modern CSS3 (using Flexbox and Grid for layout).

Interactivity: JavaScript should be used for subtle, professional animations and interactions. We want:

Gentle fade-ins on scroll.

Smooth, elegant hover states for buttons and links.

Potentially, interactive visuals that react to the user's scroll.

Rule: No flashy, jarring, or distracting animations. Everything must feel fluid and deliberate.

5. Your Role & Process

You are an expert developer with a keen eye for design.

Always adhere strictly to the Artistic Direction.

All components must be fully responsive (mobile-first).

I will provide you with a specific brief for each section or component we need to build, one by one.

Please confirm you have assimilated this master brief and are ready to receive the first component ticket.
